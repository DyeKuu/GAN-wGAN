# GAN-wGAN

## Source Code

### GAN-Gaussian

The source code is `GAN_Gaussian.ipynb`.

### WGAN-Gaussian

The source code is `wGAN_Gaussian.ipynb`.

### Application on the mnist data set

We use the file `MNIST- GAN&WGAN.ipynb` to generate number images based on the mnist data set by GAN and WGAN.

Run all the cells in order and then two number images will be generated by GAN and WGAN. You can change the code `EPOCHS = 500` into the number of epochs you want to run.

### Application on generating music: simple model

The source code is in file `MUSIC_SIMPLE.ipynb`.

1. The data set need to be download from https://salu133445.github.io/lakh-pianoroll-dataset/dataset .

On this website:

Data of music sample is under entry LPD-5 and called "lpd-5-cleansed". Then, we need to put it in  directory `data/music_simple/lpd_5`.

Data of file IDs and the matched MSD IDs is under entry LPC-cleansed and called "cleansed_ids.txt". Then, we need to put it in  directory `data/music_simple/amg`.

2. A result of generated music is saved at `results/music_simple/generated_music.mp3`.

### MuseGAN

The source code is at https://github.com/salu133445/musegan.

A result of generated music is saved at `.Music/MuseGAN/best_samples.mp3`.

## Result

All our results are in the `results` folder.

## Other Folders

-   `imgs` and `models` are used to stored intermediate result. They are by default empty.
-   `data` is the folder to store data input of MNIST experiment.
