# GAN-wGAN


### GAN-Gaussian

The source code is GAN_Gaussian.ipynb.

### Application on the mnist data set

We use the file `MNIST- GAN&WGAN.ipynb` to generate number images based on the mnist data set by GAN and WGAN. 

Run all the cells in order and then two number images will be generated by GAN and WGAN.  You can change the code `EPOCHS =  500` into the number of epochs you want to run. 


### Application og generating music: simple model
The source code is in file Music/Music_simple/music_simple.ipynb.
The data set need to be download from https://salu133445.github.io/lakh-pianoroll-dataset/dataset . 
On this website:
Data of music sample is under entry LPD-5  and called "lpd-5-cleansed". 
Data of file IDs and the matched MSD IDs is under entry LPC-cleansed and called "cleansed_ids.txt".

### MuseGAN

The source code is at https://github.com/salu133445/musegan.

A result of generated music is saved at `.Music/MuseGAN/best_samples.mp3`.
