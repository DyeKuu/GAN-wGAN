# GAN-wGAN

### Appliction on mnist data set

We use the file `MNIST- GAN&WGAN.ipynb` to generate number images based on mnist data set by GAN and WGAN. 

Run all the cells in order and two number images will be generated by GAN and WGAN.  You can change the code `EPOCHS =  500` into the number of epochs you want. 

### MuseGAN

The source code is at https://github.com/salu133445/musegan.

A result of generated music is saved at `.Music/MuseGAN/best_samples.mp3`.

### GAN-Gaussian

The source code is GAN_Gaussian.ipynb.
